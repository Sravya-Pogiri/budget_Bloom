  This is a code bundle for AI Chatbot Screen. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/QDyjVnRS2Z8wZQJ1NkmqvA/AI-Chatbot-Screen.
  
  ### Option 1: Live Demo
  Access the app directly in your browser:
  - **URL**: http://172.27.122.44:3000/
  - Works on desktop and mobile browsers
  
  ### Option 2: Run Locally
  Follow the steps below to download and run the app on your computer.
  
  ## Local Environment Prerequisites
  
  Before running the app locally, make sure you have:
  - **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
  - **npm** (comes with Node.js)
  - **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
  
  ## Local Installation & Setup
  
  ### Step 1: Clone the Repository
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Sravya-Pogiri/budget_Bloom.git
  cd budget_Bloom
  ```
  
  ### Step 2: Switch to the Final Branch
  
  ```bash

  ```

  **Note**: The app will work without the Rutgers Meal Plan Session Token, but some features (such as meal plan tracking) will be limited.
  
  ### (Optional) Start Proxy Server for Meal Plan Features

  If you want to test the Rutgers meal plan integration, and can provide an active session key from the Rutgers Meal Plan Dashboard, open a **new terminal window** and run:

  ```bash
  npm run proxy
  ```

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
